NirvanaDesktop
==============

A simple Mac OS X desktop version of the excellent [https://nirvanahq.com/](Nirvana) GTD task-list web app. All it does is open focus.nirvanahq.com in a WebView and remember your login (specifically, Nirvana's auth token â€” this app does nothing with passwords, Keychain, etc.).

**Note** I have no affiliation with [http://peoplelikeus.ca/](People Like Us), the makers of Nirvana!

Why?
----

I think of Nirvana as an app, and it's an excellent single-page web app. I wanted to be able to quickly get to it via command-tab instead of finding the tab in my browser.

Installation
------------

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/jibberia/NirvanaDesktop/releases/tag/1.0), open the zip file, and drag Nirvana.app into your Applications folder.

Since this app isn't signed, you'll have to go into System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General and choose "Allow apps downloaded from Anywhere" (click the lock in the bottom-left and enter your password first).
